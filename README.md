## Fritiofs awesome chess engine ðŸ¤©

Read the documentation on: [fritiof.dev](http://fritiof.dev/doc/fr_chess/index.html)

### How has AI been used in this project:

- As a context aware snippets engine, e.g cases where code like `let (x, ` has been auto completed to `let (x, y) = pos`
- To generate simple doc comments, example in this project `fr_chess::Board::set_tile` is AI generated
- Get answers to simple Rust related questions like: "How can i parse a string to a usize in Rust?"

### How AI hasn't been used:

- To generate large code snippets with complex logic, all code is designed and implemented by me
- To write bigger code docs, example the docs for `fr_chess::Game::apply_move` was not generated by AI
- To ask code design related questions like: "How should i implement a way to represent a chess move in my rust code?"
